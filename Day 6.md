# üîê Implementing Basic Authentication and Authorization

In this section, we'll explore the practical aspects of implementing basic authentication and authorization using Spring Security within a Spring Boot application. Security is paramount in web applications, and Spring Security simplifies the process of protecting your application's resources.

## üíª Setting up Spring Security

Spring Security is easily integrated into Spring Boot applications. To get started, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Add Spring Security Dependency

In your `pom.xml` (Maven) or `build.gradle` (Gradle), include the Spring Security dependency:
``` xml
<!-- Maven -->
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-security</artifactId>
</dependency>
```
### Step 2: Configuration

Create a configuration class that extends `WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter` to customize security configurations. Here's a basic example:

``` java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.builders.HttpSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.EnableWebSecurity;
import org.springframework.security.config.annotation.web.configuration.WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter;

@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

    @Override
    protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .authorizeRequests()
                .antMatchers("/", "/public/**").permitAll()
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
                .and()
            .formLogin()
                .loginPage("/login")
                .permitAll()
                .and()
            .logout()
                .permitAll();
    }
}
```
In this configuration, we:

-   Allow unrestricted access to the home page (`/`) and resources in the `/public` directory.
-   Require authentication for all other requests.
-   Configure a custom login page (`/login`) and enable logout functionality.

### Step 3: User Authentication

To enable basic authentication with user credentials, you can configure an `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` bean, as shown below:
``` java
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Bean;
import org.springframework.context.annotation.Configuration;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.User;
import org.springframework.security.core.userdetails.UserDetails;
import org.springframework.security.provisioning.InMemoryUserDetailsManager;

@Configuration
public class SecurityConfig {

    @Bean
    public InMemoryUserDetailsManager userDetailsManager() {
        UserDetails user = User.withDefaultPasswordEncoder()
            .username("user")
            .password("password")
            .roles("USER")
            .build();
        return new InMemoryUserDetailsManager(user);
    }
}
```
In this example, we create an `InMemoryUserDetailsManager` bean with a single user (`user` with password `password`) who has the `USER` role.

## üõ°Ô∏è Authorizing Users Based on Roles and Permissions

Spring Security provides flexible authorization mechanisms. You can define roles and permissions to control access to different parts of your application.

### Role-Based Authorization

You can restrict access based on user roles using `.hasRole()` in your configuration:
``` java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
        .formLogin()
            .loginPage("/login")
            .permitAll()
            .and()
        .logout()
            .permitAll();
}
```
In this example, users with the `ADMIN` role can access URLs starting with `/admin/`, while those with the `USER` role can access URLs starting with `/user/`.

### Permission-Based Authorization

Spring Security also supports permission-based authorization using `.hasAuthority()`:
``` java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasAuthority("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/user/**").hasAuthority("USER")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
        .formLogin()
            .loginPage("/login")
            .permitAll()
            .and()
        .logout()
            .permitAll();
}
```
In this case, users are granted permissions such as `ADMIN` or `USER` rather than roles.

## üöß Implementing Access Control

Access control is essential for securing specific endpoints or resources within your application. Spring Security provides fine-grained access control using `.hasRole()`, `.hasAuthority()`, `.permitAll()`, and more.

Here's a simple example:
``` java
@Override
protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeRequests()
            .antMatchers("/public/**").permitAll()
            .antMatchers("/admin/**").hasRole("ADMIN")
            .antMatchers("/user/**").hasRole("USER")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
            .and()
        .formLogin()
            .loginPage("/login")
            .permitAll()
            .and()
        .logout()
            .permitAll();
}
```
In this configuration, we allow public access to URLs starting with `/public/`, restrict access to `/admin/` for users with the `ADMIN` role, and restrict access to `/user/` for users with the `USER` role. All other requests require authentication.
