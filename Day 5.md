import org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.SpringBootApplication;

@SpringBootApplication
public class WebAppDemoApplication {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpringApplication.run(WebAppDemoApplication.class, args);
    }
}
```
This minimal application demonstrates how Spring Boot initializes a web application with just a few lines of code.

In Day 5, we'll delve deeper into creating controllers and views, exploring template engines, and implementing the model-view-controller (MVC) architecture to build dynamic and interactive web applications. üñ•Ô∏èüåêüåü

# Creating Controllers and Views üñ•

In Spring Boot web development, controllers and views play a pivotal role in handling HTTP requests and generating dynamic web content. Let's dive into these components:

## Building Controllers üèó

Controllers in Spring Boot are Java classes responsible for processing incoming HTTP requests, performing actions, and returning responses. They act as intermediaries between the client (usually a web browser) and the application's business logic.

### Key aspects of building controllers:

-   **Annotation-Based Controllers**: Spring Boot encourages the use of annotations like `@Controller` and `@RestController` to define controllers. These annotations make it easy to map HTTP requests to controller methods.

Example of a simple Spring Boot controller:
``` java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@Controller
public class HelloController {

    @GetMapping("/hello")
    public String sayHello() {
        return "hello"; // This maps to a view called "hello.html"
    }
}
```
In this example, the `@Controller` annotation marks the class as a controller, and the `@GetMapping` annotation maps the `/hello` URL to the `sayHello` method. It returns a view named "hello," which will be dynamically generated.

## Integrating Template Engines for Dynamic View Generation üõ†

When building web applications, you often need to generate dynamic HTML or other markup based on data or user interactions. Spring Boot supports various template engines to simplify this task. Two popular template engines are Thymeleaf and FreeMarker.

### **Thymeleaf**: 
Thymeleaf is a robust and widely used template engine in Spring Boot. It allows you to create templates that seamlessly blend HTML with placeholders for dynamic data.

Example of using Thymeleaf in a Spring Boot controller:

``` java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "greeting"; // This maps to a Thymeleaf template
    }
}
```
In this example, the `Model` object is used to pass data (in this case, a "message") to the Thymeleaf template. The `return "greeting"` statement maps to a Thymeleaf template named "greeting.html," which can render the dynamic content.

### **FreeMarker**: 
FreeMarker is another template engine that Spring Boot supports. It provides a template language for generating text-based documents.

Example of using FreeMarker in a Spring Boot controller:
``` java
import org.springframework.stereotype.Controller;
import org.springframework.ui.Model;
import org.springframework.web.bind.annotation.GetMapping;

@Controller
public class WelcomeController {

    @GetMapping("/welcome")
    public String welcome(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Welcome to our website!");
        return "welcome"; // This maps to a FreeMarker template
    }
}
```
Similarly to Thymeleaf, the `Model` object is used to pass data to the FreeMarker template.

By integrating these template engines with Spring Boot, you can create dynamic, data-driven views for your web applications, enhancing the user experience. üñ•üåêüõ†

# Thymeleaf and Freemarker Templates üñ•üõ†

Template engines like Thymeleaf and Freemarker are essential tools in modern web development. They allow you to create dynamic web pages by merging templates with data, making it easier to generate HTML, XML, or other output formats. In Spring Boot, both Thymeleaf and Freemarker are well-supported options for building dynamic views.

## Leveraging Thymeleaf üåº

**Thymeleaf** is a highly versatile and popular template engine in the Spring Boot ecosystem. It seamlessly integrates with Spring applications and provides a natural way to build web pages with dynamic content. Here's how you can leverage Thymeleaf:

1.  **Dependency Configuration**: To use Thymeleaf in your Spring Boot project, you need to include the Thymeleaf starter dependency in your `pom.xml` (if you're using Maven) or `build.gradle` (if you're using Gradle).
    
2.  **Template Creation**: Create HTML templates that include Thymeleaf-specific attributes and expressions. These attributes allow you to bind data to HTML elements.

``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <title>Dynamic Page</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1 th:text="${message}">Default Message</h1>
</body>
</html>
```
In this example, `${message}` is a Thymeleaf expression that will be replaced with dynamic data when the template is rendered.

3.  **Controller Integration**: In your Spring Boot controller, use the `Model` object to pass data to the Thymeleaf template.
``` java
@Controller
public class GreetingController {

    @GetMapping("/greeting")
    public String greeting(Model model) {
        model.addAttribute("message", "Hello, World!");
        return "greeting"; // This maps to the "greeting.html" Thymeleaf template
    }
}
```
By returning `"greeting"` in this controller method, Spring Boot will associate it with the "greeting.html" Thymeleaf template, resulting in a dynamic web page with the message "Hello, World!".

# Creating Dynamic Web Pages with Template-Driven Views üñ•

Using template engines like Thymeleaf and Freemarker simplifies the process of creating dynamic web pages. These template engines allow you to separate your application's logic from its presentation, making your code more maintainable and your web pages more flexible.

Benefits of using template-driven views:

-   **Dynamic Content**: You can easily insert dynamic data into your web pages, such as user information, product listings, or real-time updates.
    
-   **Consistency**: Templates ensure consistent styling and layout across your application, enhancing the user experience.
    
-   **Reusability**: Templates can be reused across different pages or even different projects, saving development time.
    
-   **Testing**: You can unit test your templates to ensure they render correctly, providing confidence in your application's behavior.
    

## Summary üñ•
In summary, Thymeleaf and Freemarker are powerful tools in Spring Boot web development for creating dynamic, data-driven web pages. Whether you're building a simple website or a complex web application, these template engines simplify the process of generating content and enhance the user experience. üåêüõ†

# Implementing Model-View-Controller (MVC) üèõÔ∏è

## Understanding the MVC Architecture üìö

The **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architectural pattern is fundamental in web development. It separates an application into three interconnected components, each with its own distinct role:

-   **Model**: Represents the application's data and logic. It manages data, enforces business rules, and communicates with the database. üìäüìà
    
-   **View**: Handles the presentation and user interface. It displays data to the user and captures user input. üñºÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è
    
-   **Controller**: Acts as an intermediary between the Model and the View. It receives user input from the View, processes it, interacts with the Model to update data or retrieve information, and updates the View accordingly. üéÆüéØ
    

## MVC offers several advantages, including:

-   **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a specific responsibility, making the application more organized and maintainable. üß©üì¶
    
-   **Reusability**: Models and Views can be reused in different parts of the application, promoting code reuse and reducing redundancy. üîÑüîÑ
    
-   **Testability**: Each component can be unit tested independently, ensuring the reliability and quality of your application. üß™üìä
    

## Applying MVC Concepts in Spring Boot üõ†Ô∏è

1.  **Create Model Classes**: Define Java classes to represent your application's data. These classes serve as the Model and should include fields, business logic, and database interactions if needed. üìãüè≠
    
2.  **Develop Controllers**: Create controller classes to handle HTTP requests and manage the application's flow. Annotate these classes with `@Controller` to indicate that they are part of the Controller layer. üéÆüïπÔ∏è
 ``` java
 @Controller
public class ProductController {
    @Autowired
    private ProductService productService;

    @GetMapping("/products")
    public String listProducts(Model model) {
        List<Product> products = productService.getAllProducts();
        model.addAttribute("products", products);
        return "products/list";
    }

    // Other controller methods for handling different actions
}
```
In this example, the `ProductController` handles requests related to products and interacts with the `ProductService` to fetch data from the Model.

3.  **Create Views**: Develop view templates using template engines like Thymeleaf or Freemarker. These templates are responsible for rendering HTML content and displaying data from the Model. üñºÔ∏èüëÅÔ∏è
``` html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
<head>
    <title>Product List</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Product List</h1>
    <table>
        <tr th:each="product : ${products}">
            <td th:text="${product.name}">Product Name</td>
            <td th:text="${product.price}">Product Price</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
</body>
</html>
```
In this Thymeleaf template, dynamic data from the Model is displayed in the HTML.

4.  **Configure Routes**: Use annotations like `@GetMapping` and `@PostMapping` to map URL paths to specific controller methods. These annotations define the routes that the application should respond to. üõ£Ô∏èüó∫Ô∏è

By implementing the MVC architecture üèõÔ∏è in your Spring Boot application, you achieve a clean separation of concerns, enhance reusability, and make your codebase more maintainable. It also simplifies testing and ensures that your application follows best practices in web development. üåêüöÄ
